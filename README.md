# Antarctic Glacial Analysis Toolkit (AGTK)

A collaborative, open-source toolkit for analyzing ice sheet dynamics and geospatial data in Antarctica, with a focus on the Ross Ice Shelf region.

## Purpose

The Antarctic Glacial Analysis Toolkit (AGTK) aims to standardize workflows for glacial research, ensuring reproducibility and facilitating collaboration among researchers. It provides Python scripts for processing geospatial data, documentation for best practices, and project management tools for tracking tasks.
